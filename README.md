# Ridr

##What is Ridr?

Ridr is a ride-sharing app that matches drivers with empty cars and riders who need to get somewhere. There is no cost to use
 the platform but users may be rated and your rating affects the likelihood that you will be accepted onto rides.

##Why Ridr?

There is no service that fulfills this need. Drivers often sit in traffic, looking at an empty carpool lane beside them that 
they cannot use. Riders likewise must rely on public transportation (which can be time consuming) or private transport (which 
can be expensive).

Popular events will attract hundreds or even thousands of people, many of whom make the drive alone, congesting roads and 
parking lots. If we can combine groups of people who are all going to the same place into one ride, we can eliminate traffic 
and congestion.

In the same way, daily routines (commutes) usually involve thousands of people driving alone. Some commute, but only generally 
with their coworkers.

##What is my incentive as a...

###Driver?

As a driver, you get the benefit of using the carpool lane, having a travel companion, and feeling safer on long drives 
where you'd otherwise be alone. Plus, a great travel companion will often contribute to gas/petrol costs, taking some burden
off of you.

###Rider?

As a rider, you're getting a ride directly to your destination, with a driver who is publicly rated, and generally paying only
a little gas money (optional but strongly recommended). You don't have to deal with public transportation and all of its ills.

##Plus, Ridr is good for the environment!

Taking cars off the road and encouraging carpooling means less carbon being dumped into the air. It's great for your wallet 
and great for mother earth!
